# Interview Memo

- assuming your viewer and marker they know nothing about technique
- focus more on project instead of technique
- for each slides, just briefly describe the challenge and solution, using one sentence to explain it
- demonstration should based on slides order
- when finishing my slides, then go to demonstration, don't jump around
